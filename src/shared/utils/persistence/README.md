# Persistence Adapters

This directory previously contained persistence adapters that abstracted data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

**Note:** As part of the state management refactoring, persistence logic has been moved to the new API layer in `src/shared/api/adapters/` which provides a more flexible and unified approach to data management with support for mock, offline, and live modes.
