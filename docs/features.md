# Framing Assistant

A comprehensive tool designed specifically for professional framers to calculate lumber requirements, visualize wall layouts, and generate accurate material takeoffs for residential and light commercial framing projects.

## üéØ What This Tool Does

The Framing Assistant eliminates guesswork from your framing projects by providing:

- **Accurate Material Calculations** - Precise lumber counts with waste allowance
- **Visual Wall Layouts** - Detailed elevation drawings showing every stud, plate, and opening
- **Professional Takeoffs** - Ready-to-use material lists for ordering
- **Code-Compliant Detailing** - Proper header sizing and structural requirements
- **Time-Saving Workflow** - Streamlined input process for complex wall assemblies

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Project Setup

1. **Waste Allowance** - Set your material overage percentage (typically 10-15% for framing)
2. **Stock Lengths** - Specify available lumber lengths for studs and plates
3. **Corner Configuration** - Choose between two-stud or three-stud corner assemblies
4. **Project Overview** - Review total lineal footage and wall count

### Wall Configuration

For each wall, specify:

- **Dimensions**: Length and height
- **Stud Spacing**: 16" or 24" on center (OC)
- **Plate Configuration**: 
  - Standard single top plate
  - Double top plate (recommended for most applications)
- **Bottom Plate Type**:
  - Standard bottom plate
  - Floating wall (second bottom plate + floor gap)
  - Pressure-treated bottom plate (required for concrete contact)

## ü™ü Opening Management

### Doors
- **Rough Opening Width**: Standard door sizes + 2" clearance
- **Head Height**: Typically 6'8" to 7'0" finished height
- **Left Offset**: Distance from wall start to opening edge
- **Header Size**: Based on opening width and load requirements

### Windows
- **Rough Opening Width**: Window size + 1/2" to 1" clearance
- **Rough Opening Height**: Window height + clearance
- **Sill Height**: Distance from floor to window bottom
- **Left Offset**: Distance from wall start to opening edge
- **Header Size**: Calculated based on opening span

### Automatic Component Placement
The tool automatically generates:
- **King Studs**: Full-height studs at opening sides
- **Jack Studs (Trimmers)**: Support studs under headers
- **Headers**: Load-bearing beams above openings
- **Sills**: Window bottom supports
- **Cripple Studs**: Short studs above headers and below sills

## üìê Wall Drawings & Visualization

Each wall displays as a professional elevation drawing showing:

### Structural Elements
- **Top Plates**: Single or double configuration
- **Bottom Plates**: Standard, floating, or pressure-treated
- **Stud Layout**: Proper spacing with OC measurements
- **Corner Assemblies**: Two or three-stud configurations

### Opening Details
- **King Studs**: Full-height support at opening edges
- **Jack Studs**: Header support with proper bearing
- **Headers**: Load-bearing beams with correct sizing
- **Window Sills**: Bottom support for window openings
- **Cripple Studs**: Short studs maintaining structural integrity

### Visual Legend
- Clear symbols for each component type
- Dimension callouts for critical measurements
- Material type indicators (PT, standard, etc.)

## üìã Material Takeoff & Ordering

### Studs
- **Regular Studs**: Main wall studs at specified spacing
- **Corner Studs**: Additional studs for corner assemblies
- **Jack Studs**: Header support studs
- **Cripple Studs**: Short studs for opening areas
- **Total Count**: Including waste allowance

### Plates
- **Top Plates**: Standard SPF lumber
- **Bottom Plates**: Standard SPF or pressure-treated
- **Floating Wall Plates**: Additional bottom plate for floating walls
- **Linear Footage**: Total length needed for each plate type

### Fasteners & Hardware
- **Concrete Anchors**: Spaced per code requirements (ends + every 6')
- **Nails/Screws**: Estimated quantities for assembly
- **Header Fasteners**: Specific to header size and type

### Header Material
- **Size Breakdown**: By header dimension and material type
- **Quantity**: Total pieces needed for all openings
- **Waste Allowance**: Included in calculations

## üí° Professional Tips & Best Practices

### Code Compliance
- **Header Sizing**: Based on IRC/IBC requirements for residential loads
- **Anchor Spacing**: Follows local code requirements
- **Pressure-Treated Usage**: Required for concrete contact
- **Double Top Plates**: Recommended for most applications

### Construction Efficiency
- **Stud Spacing**: 16" OC for most walls, 24" OC for non-load-bearing
- **Corner Assemblies**: Three-stud corners provide better nailing surface
- **Floating Walls**: Use in basements and areas with potential moisture
- **Waste Management**: 10-15% allowance covers cuts and defects

### Quality Control
- **Double-Check Measurements**: Verify all dimensions before ordering
- **Local Variations**: Confirm requirements with local building department
- **Material Availability**: Check stock lengths with your supplier
- **Weather Considerations**: Plan for material storage and protection
